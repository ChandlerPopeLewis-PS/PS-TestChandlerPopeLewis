## Controls
On PC: Use A and D to switch between lanes and escape to enter the pause menu.

On mobile: Swipe left and right to switch between lanes.

## Core Mechanics
1. Switching lanes to avoid obstacles (cars in this case).
2. Variable speed obstacles travelling towards you.
3. Procedurally spawning terrain, buildings and obstacles (All kept instanced in corresponding ObjectPools).
## Issues throughout development
1. The random spawning of objects kept causing them to all spawn in a line making it impossible to get passed.
2. Unity Android SDK took multiple attempts to install before it could actually use it.

## What I would have done differently
The main thing I would have done differently if I were to do the test again is to have thought about the way I implemented the obstacles a bit more before starting, I ended up switching methods halfway through which has caused some complications in the overall spawning of them.


No external artwork was used, you can probably tell :).
